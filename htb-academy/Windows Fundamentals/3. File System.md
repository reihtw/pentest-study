[]()[]()There are 5 types of Windows file systems:
- FAT12 (deprecated)
- FAT16 (deprecated)
- FAT32
- NTFS
- exFAT

## FAT32
FAT32 (FIle Allocation Table) is widely used across many types of storage devices such as USB memory sticks and SD cards but can also be used to format hard drives. The "32" in the name refers to the fact that FAT32 uses 32 bits of data for identifying data clusters on a storage device.
#### Pros:
- Device Compatibility
- Operating system cross-compatibility
#### Cons:
- Can only used with files that are less than 4GB
- No built-in data protection or file compression features
- Must use third-party tools for file encryption

## NTFS
NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.
#### Pros:
-   NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.
-   Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.
-   Supports very large-sized partitions.
-   Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.
#### Cons:
-   Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.
-   Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.

### Permissions
![[Pasted image 20230105124114.png]]Files and folders inherit the NTFS permissions of their parent folder for ease of administration, so administrators do not need to explicitly set permissions for each file and folder, as this would be extremely time-consuming. If permissions do need to be set explicitly, an administrator can disable permissions inheritance for the necessary files and folders and then set the permissions directly on each.

### Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)

The resource access level is list after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:
-   `(CI)`: container inherit
-   `(OI)`: object inherit
-   `(IO)`: inherit only
-   `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit
-   `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container
Basic access permissions are as follows:
-   `F` : full access
-   `D` :  delete access
-   `N` :  no access
-   `M` :  modify access
-   `RX` :  read and execute access
-   `R` :  read-only access
-   `W` :  write-only access
