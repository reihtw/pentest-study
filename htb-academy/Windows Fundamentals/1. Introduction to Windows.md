We can use the [Get-WmiObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject?view=powershell-5.1) [cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7) to find information about the operating system.

Some other useful classes that can be used with `Get-WmiObject` are `Win32_Process` to get a process listing, `Win32_Service` to get a listing of services `Win32_Bios` to get BIOS information. We can use the `ComputerName` parameter to get information about remote computers. `GetWmiObject` can be used to start and stop services on local and remote computers, and more. Further information about the cmdlet can be found [here](https://ss64.com/ps/get-wmiobject.html) and [here](https://adamtheautomator.com/get-wmiobject/).

## Remote Access Concepts
Some of the most common remote access technologies include but aren't limited to:
-   Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
-   Secure Shell (SSH)
-   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
-   Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
-   Windows Remote Management (or PowerShell Remoting) (WinRM)
-   Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
### Remote Desktop Protocol
RDP uses a client/server architecture where a client-side application is used to specify a computer's target IP address or hostname over a network where RDP access is enabled. The target computer where RDP remote access is enabled is considered the server. It is important to note that RDP listens by default on logical port `3389`. Keep in mind that an IP address is used as a logical identifier for a computer on a network, and a logical port is an identifier assigned to an application. In simpler terms, we could consider a network subnet a street in a town (the corporate network), an IP address in that subnet assigned to a host as a house on that street, and logical ports as windows/doors that can be used to access the house.

Once a request (encapsulated inside a packet) has reached a destination computer via its IP address, the request will be directed to an application hosted on the computer based on the port specified in that request (included as a header inside a packet). IP addressing and protocol encapsulation are covered in greater detail in the module [Introduction to Networking](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/34). From a networking perspective, in this module, we only need to understand that every computer has an IP address assigned to communicate over a network, and applications hosted on target computers listen on specific logical ports.

We can use RDP to connect to a Windows target from an attack host running Linux or Windows. If we are connecting to a Windows target from a Windows host, we can use the built-in RDP client application called `Remote Desktop Connection` ([mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)).
