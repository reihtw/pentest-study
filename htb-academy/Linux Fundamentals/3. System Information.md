#### Id
The `id` command expands on the `whoami` command and prints out our effective group membership and IDs. This can be of interest to penetration testers looking to see what access a user may have and sysadmins looking to audit account permissions and group membership. In this output, the `hackthebox` group is of interest because it is non-standard, the `adm` group means that the user can read log files in `/var/log` and could potentially gain access to sensitive information, membership in the `sudo` group is of particular interest as this means our user can run some or all commands as the all-powerful `root` user. Sudo rights could help us escalate privileges or could be a sign to a sysadmin that they may need to audit permissions and group memberships to remove any access that is not required for a given user to carry out their day-to-day tasks.

#### Uname

Running `uname -a` will print all information about the machine in a specific order: kernel name, hostname, the kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, and operating system. The `-a` flag will omit `-p` (processor type) and `-i` (hardware platform) if they are unknown.

With this info, we could go and search for "4.15.0-99-generic exploit," and the first [result](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47163) immediately appears useful to us.
