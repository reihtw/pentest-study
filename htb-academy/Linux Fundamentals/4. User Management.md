User management is an essential part of Linux administration. Sometimes we need to create new users or add other users to specific groups. Another possibility is to execute commands as a different user. After all, it is not too rare that users of only one specific group have the permissions to view or edit specific files or directories. This, in turn, allows us to collect more information locally on the machine, which can be very important. Let us take a look at the following example of how to execute code as a different user.

### Commands
- `sudo` -> Execute command as a different user.
- `su` -> The `su` utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell then is executed.
- `useradd` -> Creates a new user or updted default new user session.
- `userdel` -> Deletes user account and related files
- `usermod` -> Modifies user account
- `addgroup` -> Adds group to the system
- `delgroup` -> Removes group from the system
- `passwd` -> Changes user password.
