[]()Virtualization -> abstraction of physical computing resources.
We distinguish between:
- Hardware virtualization.
- Application virtualization
- Storage virtualization
- Data virtualization
- Network Virtualization
Hardware virtualization is about technologies that enable hardware components to be made available independently of their physical basis using hypervisor software. Example: VMs.

## Virtual Machines
A `virtual machine (VM)` is a virtual operating system that runs on a host system (an actual physical computer system). Several VMs isolated from each other can be operated in parallel. The physical hardware resources of the host system are allocated via `hypervisors`.
A hypervisor manages the hardware resources, and from the virtual machine's point of view, allocated computing power, RAM, hard disk capacity, and network connections are exclusively available.
From the application perspective, an operating system installed within the VM behaves as if installed directly on the hardware. It is not apparent to the applications or the operating system that they are running in a virtual environment. Virtualization is usually associated with performance losses for the VM because the intermediate virtualization layer itself requires resources. VMs offer numerous advantages over running an operating system or application directly on a physical system. The most important benefits are:
1. Applications and services of a VM do not interfere with each other
2. Complete independece of  the guest system from the host system's operating system and the underlying physical hardware.
3. VMs can be moved or cloned to other systems by simple copying.
4. Hardware resources can be dynamically allocated via the hypervisor
5. Better and more efficient utilization of existing hardware resources
6. Shorter procisioning times for systems and applications
7. Simplified management of virtual systems
8. Higher availability of VMs due to independence from physical resources.

## Introduction to VMware
VMware produces software products for the virtualization of computer systems. `VMware Workstation Pro` and `VMware Workstation Player` are the most interesting. The difference between the two is that, unlike Workstation Pro, Workstation Player can only run one VM at a time.
For both operating systems, Windows and Linux, the installation files can be downloaded [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html). Since most people are more familiar with Windows, we will install it on a Windows operating system.
